7913EB96	Many applications of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) require accurate time synchronization for data consistency and coordination. While the existing protocols for time synchronization provide sufficient accuracy, they consume high energy and poorly synchronize the distant nodes. We propose a Recursive Time Synchronization Protocol (RTSP) which provides global clock synchronization in an accurate and energy-efficient way. It achieves better performance by using a novel blend of techniques such as the MAC-layer time-stamping based on Start of Frame Delimiter (SFD) byte, fewer broadcasts by the reference node, compensation of the propagation delay and adjustment of the timestamps at each hop, estimation of the relative skew and offset using least square linear regression on two data points (2LR), adaptive re-synchronization interval, aggregation of the synchronization requests and energy-awareness. We also analyze the sources of errors and efficiency. Simulation results show an average accuracy of 0.3μs in a large multi-hop network while using only 1/5th of the energy consumed by FTSP in the long run, i.e., the RTSP outperforms all other protocols of its class including RBS, TPSN and FTSP.
7941F5FC	In large scale of WSNs (wireless sensor networks), a centralized algorithm is not suitable for WSNs. Distributed algorithm has the obvious advantage over traditional time synchronization algorithm. The paper proposes a distributed time synchronization algorithm for WSNs, called SNOWBALL effect time synchronization. In the algorithm, a node needs only to communicate with its neighbor node, synchronizing itself clock based on the neighbor nodes information. The algorithm is a continuous synchronization process. The network will reach balance and clock consistency after repeated algorithm iterations. In the algorithm, we achieve network energy optimization by reducing unnecessary message exchange.
76367B21	A number of time synchronization protocols for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been recently proposed aiming at maximizing the accuracy and minimizing the power efficiency. This paper proposes novel clock skew estimators for the protocols based on two-way timing message exchanges to achieve long term reliability of synchronization. The proposed clock synchronization mechanism is far more power efficient than the conventional ones by significantly increasing the re-synchronization period. Moreover, it can be applied to the conventional protocols without any additional overhead. In fact, the proposed estimators assume simple steps and low complexity, a feature which is strongly demanding for WSNs consisting of cheap and small nodes
7D4C763F	The ordering of nodes with respect to destinations of interest by means of spatial information (e.g., distances, path constituency, complete or partial topology) has been a fundamental aspect of all routing protocols in wireless networks. This spatial ordering has also included the use of geographical or virtual coordinates denoting the location of nodes. We propose the use of ordering of nodes based on time rather than space, and without the need to establish any clock synchronization among nodes. We demonstrate for the first time that using the relative times when each node receives and transmits packets is sufficient to establish multiple loop-free paths to destinations, and that such time-based ordering renders more efficient loop-free routing than the spatial ordering of nodes. With the use of self-adjusted delays, nodes can manipulate their ordering so that the resulting routing choices are more robust to failures than routing choices based solely on times driven by the physical topology. Furthermore, we show that the problem of resetting sequence numbers, which is a network-wide operation with traditional spatial ordering, is trivial with temporal ordering. We introduce the Time Ordered Routing Protocol (TORP) and compare it against routing protocols based on spatial ordering to demonstrate that temporal ordering can lead to superior performance in multi-hop wireless networks.
76DB1BAE	Pairwise Broadcast is a novel low-power wireless sensor network clock synchronization method. A subset of sensor nodes are synchronized by overhearing the timing message exchanges of a pair of sensor nodes. Therefore, a group of sensor nodes can be synchronized without sending any extra messages. This paper mainly account for the problem that the original Pairwise Broadcast Synchronization in absence of the clock skew between the pairwise broadcast node, proposed that use MLE(Maximum Likelihood Estimation) for accurate estimation of the clock offset and clock skew of nodes under Gaussian delay model. The simulation results indicate this method to ensure high accuracy simultaneously effectively reduce energy consumption.
5B0E344F	Time Synchronization in wireless networks is extremely important for basic communication, but it also provides the ability to detect movement, location, and proximity. The synchronization problem consists of four parts: send time, access time, propagation time, and receive time. Three current synchronization protocol Reference Broadcast Synchronization, Timing-sync Protocol for Sensor Networks, and Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol are presented and how they attempt solve the synchronization problem is also discussed. Security concerns as well as an industry case are also presented. 
77104C17	Wireless sensor networks are a nascent type of ad-hoc networks that had drawn the interest of the research community in last few years. They require working together for distributed tasks. Accurate and reliable time is one of the needs for some of its applications. The use of traditional time synchronization protocols for wired network is restricted by severe energy constraint in sensor network. The realization of time synchronized network poses many challenges, which are the subject of active research in the fileld. In this paper we argue that clock synchronization provides a lot of overhead, and can be eliminated in some of the cases. We advocate that sensor should be allowed to run unsynchronized. The time when any event of interest occurs, the sensor node records that event in its memory with timestamp from its cluster head's clock, instead of its local clock.
7C1B594D	An improved approach, called receiver only synchronization (ROS), relative to timing synch protocol for sensor networks (TPSN) was devised based on a two-way timing message exchange mechanism between two nodes. In ROS, all the nodes in their transmission range overhear the messages and adjust their clock parameters without having to communicate by themselves, hence saving a lot of energy. In this paper, we are proving that in ROS, one-way timing message transmission from the root node to the neighboring nodes located within its transmission range is superior to the two-way timing message exchange. Also, we are showing that choosing the more accurate model instead of the linear regression model yields further performance gains for the clock parameters estimation.
178CABEE	In this paper, a novel clock synch algorithm for WSN based on Pairwise Broadcast (PB) is investigated. Within the proposed approach, a cluster based time synch topology is constructed by broadcast and two-way message exchange mechanism. In each cluster, several assistant Cluster Heads (CHs) are voted upon the neighborhood of member nodes, resulting in fine-gradient cluster segmentation. On the basis of the topology, an improved clock estimator with unknown fixed delay is addressed. Herein, we induce clock parameters by General Linear Model as well as the fixed delay by Maximum Likelihood Estimation. Moreover, the performance analysis of the estimator is carried out. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm is prominent on synch overhead and that it achieves better performance in terms of synch accuracy.
76684966	The International Atomic Time TAI is a physically realized time scale which is ultimately used for comparisons between observations and dynamical theories. Its definition should tell unambiguously what an ideal TAI should be. For terrestrial applications, TAI has been defined as a geocentric coordinate time. In Solar System Dynamics, a barycentric coordinate time is needed. In general, it is not possible to convert a coordinate time into another coordinate time. But a specific clock synchronized on TAI in the terrestrial system can be considered as reading a ‘modified’, proper time [TAI]i, which can be converted into a barycentric coordinate time. In this conversion appears a small location dependent term. By this process all the clocks of the TAI system give an unique barycentric time with the same metrological properties as TAI.
5A68FCE2	The   possibility   of   establishing   the chronology   of   events   in   a   widely   distributed network,      or      even      stronger,      the timesynchronization  of  all  nodes  in  the  network  is often  needed  for  applications  of  wireless  sensor networks. In  this  paper  we describethe Flooding Time    Synchronization    Protocol    (FTSP) that providestime   synchronization   service   in   such networks. The  protocol was  designed  to utilize low   communication   bandwidth,   scale   well   for medium  ized  multi-hop  networks,  and  be  robust against  topology  changes  and  node  failures.  The FTSP achieves ts robustness by utilizing periodic radio broadcast of synchronization messages and implicit   dynamic   opology   update.   MAC-layer time-stamping,   comprehensive compensation   oferrors  and linear  regression  re  used  to  achieve high accuracy. The resulting time synchronization rror of the FTSP is significantly ower than that  the  existing  RBS  and  TPSN  algorithms.The data  from a  comprehensive  multi-hop  experiment shows the  average  network-wide  synchronization error to   be in   the   microsecond   range.   The protocol  was  further  validated  as  part  of  our countersniper system that was field tested in a US military facility.
63A0B5A5	We consider the problem of clock synchronization in a wireless setting where processors must minimize the number of times their radios are used to save energy. Energy efficiency is a central goal in wireless networks, especially if energy resources are severely limited, as occurs in sensor and ad hoc networks, and in many other settings. The problem of clock synchronization is fundamental and intensively studied in the field of distributed algorithms. In the current setting, the problem is to synchronize clocks of m processors that wake up in arbitrary time points, such that the maximum difference between wake-up times is bounded by a positive integer n. (Time intervals are appropriately discretized to allow communication of all processors that are awake in the same discrete time unit.) Currently, the best-known results for synchronization for single-hop networks of m processors is a randomized algorithm due to Bradonjic et al. [2009] of O(√n/m ⋅ poly-log(n)) radio use times per processor, and a lower bound of Ω (√n/m). The main open question left in their work is to close the poly-log gap between the upper and the lower bound, and to derandomize their probabilistic construction and eliminate error probability. This is exactly what we do in this article. That is, we show a deterministic algorithm with radio use of Θ (√n/m), which exactly matches the lower bound proven in Bradonjic et al. [2009] to a small multiplicative constant. Therefore, our algorithm is optimal in terms of energy efficiency and completely resolves a long sequence of works in this area [Bradonjic et al. 2009; Moscribroda et al. 2006; McGlynn and Borbash 2001; Polastre et al. 2004]. Moreover, our algorithm is optimal in terms of running time as well. To achieve these results, we devise a novel adaptive technique that determines the times when devices power their radios on and off. This technique may be of independent interest.In addition, we prove several lower bounds on the energy efficiency of algorithms for multihop networks. Specifically, we show that any algorithm for multihop networks must have radio use of Ω (√n) per processor. Our lower bounds hold even for specific kinds of networks, such as networks modeled by unit disk graphs and highly connected graphs. Our results imply that the simple deterministic algorithm devised for two-processor networks in Bradonjic et al. [2009] with efficiency O(√n) can be used in multihop networks, and it is the most efficient solution in terms of energy use.
80081FB9	Large propagation delay and node movement are considered to be two significant attributes that differentiate an underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN) from a ground wireless sensor network (WSN). Considering the effects of both propagation delay and movement, we propose a time synchronization algorithm suitable for a UWSN. An underwater node can move out of and into another node's range frequently. With the proposed algorithm, no time synchronization is necessary if the time stamps of the received data packets are within the tolerance. In this fashion, the network underwater does not need to perform global time synchronizations periodically, which reduces the time used to synchronize clocks among sensor nodes. The simulation results show the time cost for synchronization is linear to the data packets exchanged.
7F95D7EE	Time synchronization may play a key role in wireless sensor networks to meet real-time and energy-saving requirements and improve data-fusion and multiplexing efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a clock synchronization algorithm between the base station and sensor node used in wireless check meter system. The algorithm can not only been extended more conveniently, but also less affected by environment. The algorithm is implemented in the platform of s3c2410 solidified OS of Windows CE.Net. So the most important interrupt delay contributor, ISR and IST, can not be ignored, A result for the maximum clock skew of the hardware-based synchronization is presented, which can fulfill the need of wireless sensor networks built for wireless check meter system.
8022410E	This paper presents a synchronization protocol for real-time multimedia application in wireless networks. A multimedia stream is multicast from one to some mobile terminals (MTs). Source and receivers can both be mobile. The protocol allows MTs to receive a multicast stream without breaks in playback as MTs move from cell to cell. The scheme is general because we make no assumption about clocks synchronization and messages are not time-stamped. However, it is used in a network having bounded delays. Verifications show that synchronization properties are respected. Moreover, simulations show that the strategy of known locations reduces the handoff duration compared to the one of unknown locations and then preserves the synchronization.
5F021DDB	Optical networks are widely regarded as the ultimate solution to the bandwidth needs of future communication systems. With fiber-optic links deployed between nodes, the electronic devices at the switch nodes, rather than the transmission medium, limit the bandwidth of a network. In an optically-switched network, a photonic switch can control connection paths without optical-to-electrical (O-E) conversion of the signal, thereby avoiding speed and data-format restrictions im- posed by such conversions. Despite the recognized potential of optically-switched multiwavelength networks, however, their overall effectiveness remains hampered by problems related to signal impairment such as noise, crosstalk and dispersion ac- cumulating over a transparent path, and a finite number of wavelengths available limiting the network size. Moreover, the absence of O-E conversions prevents their application to certain areas, most notably, packet switches.
77B2E72B	Time synchronization is extremely important for wireless sensor networks. Since the sensors have very limited energy resources and it is very difficult to change batteries for the sensor nodes, energy efficiency is one of primary importance for a sensor network. To prolong the lifetime of a sensor network, we proposed a cluster based on demand time synchronization in wireless sensor networks(COD). In this protocol many nodes are set to “sleep” modes in most cases, for the formation of clustering and time synchronization procedure is initiated only when the event is detected. Compared to other clock synchronizat- ion protocols, the COD simulation results show that it is more energy efficient than RBS and FTSP.
5DDE6ADB	Clock synchronization is a crucial service in many distributed systems, including wireless ad-hoc networks. This paper studies external clock synchronization, in which nodes should bring their clocks close to the value of some external reference time, which is provided in the system by one or more source clocks.Reference broadcast synchronization (RBS) is a known approach that exploits the broadcast nature of wireless networks for a single hop. However, when networks are large in physical extent, additional mechanisms must be employed.Using multi-hop algorithms that re-broadcast time information to short distances reduces the energy consumed for clock synchronization. The reason is that energy costs grow more than linearly with the broadcast distance. On the other hand, the quality of the clock synchronization, as measured in the closeness of the clocks, deteriorates as the number of hops increases.This paper shows how to balance these two contradictory goals, achieving optimal clock synchronization while adhering to an energy budget at each node. In particular, a distributed algorithm is presented that uses multi-hop broadcasting over a shallow infrastructure to synchronize the clocks. The closeness of clock synchronization achieved by the algorithm is proved to be optimal for the given energy constraints.
061A259D	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) assume a collection of tiny sensing devices connected wirelessly and which are used to observe and monitor a variety of phenomena in the real physical world. Time synchronization is an important issue in wireless sensor networks.  Many applications based on these WSNs assume local clocks need to be synchronized to a common view of clock at each sensor node. Some essential limitations of sensor networks such as limited energy resources, storage, computation, and bandwidth, combined with potentially high density of nodes make traditional synchronization methods incompatible for these networks. Hence, an increasing research focus on designing synchronization schemes is required. This paper reviews existing time synchronization protocols and the need for synchronization in sensor networks and then presents the proposed algorithm to construct adhoc tree structure of sensor network along with the process of clock synchronization. 
816D7F63	Accurately synchronized clocks are crucial for many applications in sensor networks. Existing time synchronization algorithms provide on average good synchronization between arbitrary nodes, however, as we show in this paper, close-by nodes in a network may be synchronized poorly. We propose the Gradient Time Synchronization Protocol (GTSP) which is designed to provide accurately synchronized clocks between neighbors. GTSP works in a completely decentralized fashion: Every node periodically broadcasts its time information. Synchronization messages received from direct neighbors are used to calibrate the logical clock. The algorithm requires neither a tree topology nor a reference node, which makes it robust against link and node failures. The protocol is implemented on the Mica2 platform using TinyOS. We present an evaluation of GTSP on a 20-node testbed setup and simulations on larger network topologies.
80C888C7	Time-based localization approaches attract a lot of interest due to their high accuracy and potentially low cost for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, time-based localization is tightly coupled with clock synchronization. Thus, the reliability of timestamps in time-based localization becomes an important yet challenging task to deal with. In this paper, we propose robust time-based localization strategies to locate a target node with the help of anchors (nodes with known positions) in asynchronous networks. Two kinds of asynchronous networks are considered: one only with clock offsets, labeled quasi-synchronous networks, whereas the other with not only clock offsets but also clock skews, labeled fully asynchronous networks. A novel ranging protocol is developed for both networks, namely asymmetric trip ranging (ATR), to reduce the communication load and explore the broadcast property of WSNs. Regardless of the reliability of the timestamp report from the target node, closed-form least-squares (LS) estimators are derived to accurately estimate the target node position. As a result, we counter the uncertainties caused by the target node by ignoring the timestamps from this node. Furthermore, in order to simplify the estimator in fully asynchronous networks, localization and synchronization are decoupled. A simple yet efficient method is proposed to first Calibrate the Clock Skews of the anchors, and then Estimate the Node Position (CCS-ENP). Finally, Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs) and simulation results corroborate the efficiency of our localization schemes.
78DA4353	It is known that clock synchronization can be achieved in the presence of faulty processors as long as the nonfaulty processors are connected, provided that some authentication technique is used. Without authentication the number of faults that can be tolerated has been an open question. Here we show that if we restrict logical clocks to running within some linear functions of real time, then clock synchronization is impossible without authentication when one-third or more of the processors are faulty. We also provide a lower bound on the closeness to which simultaneity can be achieved in the network as a function of the transmission and processing delay properties of the network.
7F1F639A	We study the problem of clock synchronization in highly dynamic networks, where communication links can appear or disappear at any time. The nodes in the network are equipped with hardware clocks, but the rate of the hardware clocks can vary arbitrarily within specific bounds, and the estimates that nodes can obtain about the clock values of other nodes are inherently inaccurate. Our goal in this setting is to output a logical clock at each node, such that the logical clocks of any two nodes are not too far apart, and nodes that remain close to each other in the network for a long time are better synchronized than distant nodes. This property is called gradient clock synchronization.Gradient clock synchronization has been widely studied in the static setting. We show that the bounds for the static case also apply to our highly dynamic setting: if two nodes remain at distance d from each other for sufficiently long, it is possible to synchronize their clocks to within O(d log(D/d)), where D is the diameter of the network. This is known to be optimal for static networks, and since a static network is a special case of a dynamic network, it is optimal for dynamic networks as well. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm has optimal stabilization time: when a path of length d appears between two nodes, the time required until the skew between the two nodes is reduced to O(d log(D/d)) is O(D), which we prove is optimal.
7D58E42C	A probabilistic method is proposed for reading remote clocks in distributed systems subject to unbounded random communication delays. The method can achieve clock synchronization precisions superior to those attainable by previously published clock synchronization algorithms. Its use is illustrated by presenting a time service which maintains externally (and hence, internally) synchronized clocks in the presence of process, communication and clock failures.
7641A8AA	We consider the problem of synchronizing the clocks of processors in a failure-free distributed system when the hardware clocks do not drift but there is uncertainty in the message delays. Our goal is to develop closed form expressions for how closely the clocks can be synchronized. For an arbitrary undirected topology with arbitrary (symmetric) uncertainties, we prove a lower bound of diam/2 on the closeness of synchronization achievable, where diam is the diameter of the graph when the edges are weighted with the uncertainties. We then consider the class of topologies described as k-ary m-cubes, both with and without wrap-around. We assume that every edge has the same uncertainty, u. For the k-ary m-cube without wrap-around, we show that our lower bound diam/2 = um(k-1)/2 is tight, by analyzing the synchronization achieved by a simple algorithm. Since chains, meshes, and hypercubes are special cases of this topology, we have tight bounds for them. For the k-ary m-cube with wrap-around, we show using the same algorithm that our lower bound diam/2 = u*m*floor(k/2)/2 is tight when k is even and is almost tight when k is odd. This result implies tight or almost tight bounds for rings and tori. 
7FD9D0A2	The cost of synchronizing a multicomputer increases with system size. For large multicomputers, the time and resources spent to enable each node to estimate the clock value of every other node in the system can be prohibitive. We show how to reduce the cost of synchronization by assigning each node to one or more groups, then having each node estimate the clock values of only those nodes with which it shares a group. Since each node estimates the clock value of only a subset of the nodes, the cost of synchronization can be significantly reduced. We also provide a method for computing the maximum skew between any two nodes in the multicomputer, and a method for computing the maximum time between synchronizations. We also show how the fault tolerance of the synchronization algorithm may be determined.
76E618BA	We present a novel clock synchronization algorithm and prove tight upper and lower bounds on the worst-case clock skew that may occur between any two participants in any given distributed system. More importantly, the worst-case clock skew between neighboring nodes is (asymptotically) at most a factor of two larger than the best possible bound. While previous results solely focused on the dependency of the skew bounds on the network diameter, we prove that our techniques are optimal also with respect to the maximum clock drift, the uncertainty in message delays, and the imposed bounds on the clock rates. The presented results all hold in a general model where both the clock drifts and the message delays may vary arbitrarily within pre-specified bounds.Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits a number of other highly desirable properties. First, the algorithm ensures that the clock values remain in an affine linear envelope of real time. A better worst-case bound on the accuracy with respect to real time cannot be achieved in the absence of an external timer. Second, the algorithm minimizes the number and size of messages that need to be exchanged in a given time period. Moreover, only a small number of bits must be stored locally for each neighbor. Finally, our algorithm can easily be adapted for a variety of other prominent synchronization models.
7D466127	Recently, a few efficient timing synchronization protocols for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been proposed with the goal of maximizing the accuracy and minimizing the power utilization. This paper proposes novel clock skew estimators assuming different delay environments to achieve energy-efficient network-wide synchronization for WSNs. The proposed clock skew correction mechanism significantly increases the re-synchronization period, which is a critical factor in reducing the overall power consumption. The proposed synchronization scheme can be applied to the conventional protocols without additional overheads. Moreover, this paper derives the Cramer-Rao lower bounds and the maximum likelihood estimators under different delay models and assumptions. These analytical metrics serves as good benchmarks for the thus far reported experimental results
7A92DF05	Synchronization and localization are critical challenges for the coherent functioning of a wireless network, which are conventionally solved independently. Recently, various estimators have been proposed for pairwise synchronization between immobile nodes, based on time stamp exchanges via two-way communication. In this paper, we consider a network of mobile nodes for which a novel joint time-range model is presented, treating both unsynchronized clocks and the pairwise distances as a polynomial functions of true time. For a pair of nodes, a least squares solution is proposed for estimating the pairwise range parameters between the nodes, in addition to estimating the clock offsets and clock skews. Extending these pairwise solutions to network-wide ranging and clock synchronization, we present a central data fusion based global least squares algorithm. A unique solution is nonexistent without a constraint on the cost function e.g., a clock reference node. Ergo, a constrained framework is proposed and a new Constrained Cramér-Rao Bound (CCRB) is derived for the joint time-range model. In addition, to alleviate the need for a single clock reference, various clock constraints are presented and their benefits are investigated using the proposed solutions. Simulations are conducted and the algorithms are shown to approach the theoretical limits.
77881AE4	We study the problem of clock synchronization in highly dynamic networks, where communication links can appear or disappear at any time. The nodes in the network are equipped with hardware clocks, but the rate of the hardware clocks can vary arbitrarily within specific bounds, and the estimates that nodes can obtain about the clock values of other nodes are inherently inaccurate. Our goal in this setting is to output a logical clock at each node, such that the logical clocks of any two nodes are not too far apart, and nodes that remain close to each other in the network for a long time are better synchronized than distant nodes. This property is called gradient clock synchronization.Gradient clock synchronization has been widely studied in the static setting. We show that the bounds for the static case also apply to our highly dynamic setting: if two nodes remain at distance d from each other for sufficiently long, it is possible to synchronize their clocks to within O(d log(D/d)), where D is the diameter of the network. This is known to be optimal for static networks, and since a static network is a special case of a dynamic network, it is optimal for dynamic networks as well. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm has optimal stabilization time: when a path of length d appears between two nodes, the time required until the skew between the two nodes is reduced to O(d log(D/d)) is O(D), which we prove is optimal.
76E0C500	We describe a new fault-tolerant algorithm for solving a variant of Lamport's clock synchronization problem. The algorithm is designed for a system of distributed processes that communicate by sending messages. Each process has its own read-only physical clock whose drift rate from real time is very small. By adding a value to its physical clock time, the process obtaines its local time. The algorithm solves the problem of maintaining closely synchronized local times, assuming that processes' local times are closely synchronized initially. The algorithm is able to tolerate the failure of just under one-third of the participating processes. It maintains synchronization to within a small constant, whose magnitude depends upon the rate of clock drift, the message delivery time and its uncertainty, and the initial closeness of synchronization. We also give a characterization of how far the clocks drift from real time. Reintegration of a repaired process can be accomplished using a slight modification of the basic alborithm. A similar style algorithm can also be used to achieve synchronization initially.
7CF95A36	This letter proposes an energy-efficient clock synchronization scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) based on a novel time synchronization approach. Within the proposed synchronization approach, a subset of sensor nodes are synchronized by overhearing the timing message exchanges of a pair of sensor nodes. Therefore, a group of sensor nodes can be synchronized without sending any extra messages. This paper brings two main contributions: 1. Development of a novel synchronization approach which can be partially or fully applied for implementation of new synchronization protocols and for improving the performance of existing time synchronization protocols. 2. Design of a time synchronization scheme which significantly reduces the overall network-wide energy consumption without incurring any loss of synchronization accuracy compared to other well-known schemes.
7FC275BB	We introduce the distributed gradientclock synchronization problem. As in traditional distributed clock synchronization, we consider a network of nodes equipped with hardware clocks with bounded drift. Nodes compute logical clock values based on their hardware clocks and message exchanges, and the goal is to synchronize the nodes' logical clocks as closely as possible, while satisfying certain validity conditions. The new feature of gradient clock synchronization GCS for short) is to require that the skew between any two nodesy' logical clocks be bounded by a nondecreasing function of the uncertainty in message delay (call this the distance) between the two nodes, and other network parameters. That is, we require nearby nodes to be closely synchronized, and allow faraway nodes to be more loosely synchronized. We contrast GCS with traditional clock synchronization, and discuss several practical motivations for GCS, mostly arising in sensor and ad-hoc networks. Our main result is that the worst case clock skew between two nodes at distance d or less from each other is Ω(d + logDloglogD), where D is the diameter of the network. This means that clock synchronization is not a localproperty, in the sense that the clock skew between two nodes depends not only on the distance between the nodes, but also on the size of the network. Our lower bound implies, for example, that the TDMA protocol with a fixed slot granularity will fail as the network grows, even if the maximum degree of each node stays constant.
7F0F7624	A clock synchronization scheme that strikes a balance between hardware and software solutions is proposed. The proposed scheme is a software algorithm that uses minimal additional hardware to achieve reasonably tight synchronization. Unlike other software solutions, the guaranteed worst-cast skews can be made insensitive to the maximum variation of message transit delay in the system. The scheme is particularly suitable for large partially connected distributed systems with topologies that support simple point-to-point broadcast algorithms. Examples of such topologies include the hypercube and the mesh interconnection structures.
7849ABA5	Recent advances in micro-electromechanical (MEMS) technology have led to the development of small, low-cost, and low-power sensors. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are large-scale networks of such sensors, dedicated to observing and monitoring various aspects of the physical world. In such networks, data from each sensor is agglomerated using data fusion to form a single meaningful result, which makes time synchronization between sensors highly desirable. This paper surveys and evaluates existing clock synchronization protocols based on a palette of factors like precision, accuracy, cost, and complexity. The design considerations presented here can help developers either in choosing an existing synchronization protocol or in defining a new protocol that is best suited to the specific needs of a sensor-network application. Finally, the survey provides a valuable framework by which designers can compare new and existing synchronization protocols.
756A3BB8	The problem of achieving optimal clock synchronization in a communication network with arbitrary topology and perfect clocks (that do not drift) is studied. Clock synchronization algorithms are presented for a large family of delay assumptions. Our algorithms are modular and consist of three major components. The first component holds for any type of delay assumptions; the second component holds for a large, natural family of local delay assumptions; the third component must be tailored for each specific delay assumption.Optimal clock synchronization algorithms are derived for several types of delay assumptions by appropriately tuning the third component. The delay assumptions include lower and upper delay bounds, no bounds at all, and bounds on the difference of the delay in opposite directions. In addition, our model handles systems where some processors are connected by broadcast networks in which every message arrives at all the processors at approximately the same time. A composition theorem allows combinations of different assumptions for different links or even for the same link; such mixtures are common in practice.Our results achieve the best possible precision in each execution. This notion of optimality is stronger than the more common notion of worst-case optimality. The new notion of optimality applies to systems where the worst-case behavior of any clock synchronization algorithm is inherently unbounded. 
7F7D7BBD	The development of tiny, low-cost, low-power and multifunctional sensor nodes equipped with sensing, data processing, and communicating components, have been made possible by the recent advances in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) assume a collection of such tiny sensing devices connected wirelessly and which are used to observe and monitor a variety of phenomena in the real physical world. Many applications based on these WSNs assume local clocks at each sensor node that need to be synchronized to a common notion of time. This paper reviews the existing clock synchronization protocols for WSNs and the methods of estimating clock offset and clock skew in the most representative clock synchronization protocols for WSNs.
79D02E4A	Having access to an accurate time is a vital building block in all networks; in wireless sensor networks even more so, because wireless media access or data fusion may depend on it. Starting out with a novel analysis, we show that orthodox clock synchronization algorithms make fundamental mistakes. The state-of-the-art clock synchronization algorithm FTSP exhibits an error that grows exponentially with the size of the network, for instance. Since the involved parameters are small, the error only becomes visible in midsize networks of about 10--20 nodes. In contrast, we present PulseSync, a new clock synchronization algorithm that is asymptotically optimal. We evaluate PulseSync on a Mica2 testbed, and by simulation on larger networks. On a 20 node network, the prototype implementation of PulseSync outperforms FTSP by a factor of 5. Theory and simulation show that for larger networks, PulseSync offers an accuracy which is several orders of magnitude better than FTSP. To round off the presentation, we investigate several optimization issues, e.g. media access and local skew.
7BDEF745	We describe a new fault-tolerant algorithm for solving a variant of Lamport's clock synchronization problem. The algorithm is designed for a system of distributed processes that communicate by sending messages. Each process has its own read-only physical clock whose drift rate from real time is very small. By adding a value to its physical clock time, the process obtaines its local time. The algorithm solves the problem of maintaining closely synchronized local times, assuming that processes' local times are closely synchronized initially. The algorithm is able to tolerate the failure of just under one-third of the participating processes. It maintains synchronization to within a small constant, whose magnitude depends upon the rate of clock drift, the message delivery time and its uncertainty, and the initial closeness of synchronization. We also give a characterization of how far the clocks drift from real time. Reintegration of a repaired process can be accomplished using a slight modification of the basic alborithm. A similar style algorithm can also be used to achieve synchronization initially.
79826E19	We present a novel clock synchronization algorithm and prove tight upper and lower bounds on the worst-case clock skew that may occur between any two participants in any given distributed system. More importantly, the worst-case clock skew between neighboring nodes is (asymptotically) at most a factor of two larger than the best possible bound. While previous results solely focused on the dependency of the skew bounds on the network diameter, we prove that our techniques are optimal also with respect to the maximum clock drift, the uncertainty in message delays, and the imposed bounds on the clock rates. The presented results all hold in a general model where both the clock drifts and the message delays may vary arbitrarily within pre-specified bounds. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits a number of other highly desirable properties. First, the algorithm ensures that the clock values remain in an affine linear envelope of real time. A better worst-case bound on the accuracy with respect to real time cannot be achieved in the absence of an external timer. Second, the algorithm minimizes the number and size of messages that need to be exchanged in a given time period. Moreover, only a small number of bits must be stored locally for each neighbor. Finally, our algorithm can easily be adapted for a variety of other prominent synchronization models. 
80C59B4C	Over the last years, large-scale decentralized computer networks such as peer-to-peer and mobile ad hoc networks have become increasingly prevalent. The topologies of many of these networks are often highly dynamic. This is especially true for ad hoc networks formed by mobile wireless devices.In this paper, we study the fundamental problem of clock synchronization in dynamic networks. We show that there is an inherent trade-off between the skew S guaranteed along sufficiently old links and the time needed to guarantee a small skew along new links: for any sufficiently large initial skew on a new link, there are executions in which the time required to reduce the skew on the link to O(S) is at least Ω(n/S).We show that this bound is tight for moderately small values of S. Assuming a fixed set of n nodes, an arbitrary pattern of edge insertions and removals, and a weak dynamic connectivity requirement, we present an algorithm that always maintains a skew of O(n) between any two nodes in the network. For a parameter S=Ω(ρn−−√), where ρ is the maximum hardware clock drift, it is further guaranteed that if a communication link between two nodes u,v persists in the network for Θ(n/S) time, the clock skew between u and v is reduced to no more than O(S).
815E7D30	Time synchronization is an important research issue in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Many applications based on these WSNs assume local clocks at each sensor node that need to be synchronized to a common notion of time. Some inherent properties of sensor networks such as limited energy, storage, computation, and bandwidth resources, combined with potentially high density of nodes make conventional synchronization methods unsuitable for these networks. Therefore, an increasing research focus on designing synchronization algorithms is required. In this paper we explore various time synchronization protocols and present theoretical analysis of protocols based on quantitative and qualitative criteria with the proposed Tree Structured Time Synchronization Protocol. The comparative study shows that it is an excellent conciliation among synchronization accuracy, computational complexity, and convergence time.
7CE46771	We present a simple, efficient, and unified solution to the problems of synchronizing, initializing, and integrating clocks for systems with different types of failures: crash, omission, and arbitrary failures with and without message authentication. This is the first known solution that achieves optimal accuracy—the accuracy of synchronized clocks (with respect to real time) is as good as that specified for the underlying hardware clocks. The solution is also optimal with respect to the number of faulty processes that can be tolerated to achieve this accuracy.
