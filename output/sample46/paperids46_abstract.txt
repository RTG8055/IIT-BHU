7FD617C5	For a wide family of multivariate Hausdorff operators, the boundedness of an operator from this family is proved on the real Hardy space. By this we extend and strengthen previous results due to Andersen and Móricz. 
815A60F5	While automatic image registration has been extensively studied in other areas of image processing, it is still a complex problem in the framework of remote sensing for disaster response. This problem is difficult because there can be substantial change in the image content between the two images, and the time of day and lighting typically are different between the two images. In this work, we propose a two-step approach to achieve fast and robust registration of before- after-disaster aerial image pairs. First, the images are coarsely registered using a phase-correlation based algorithm. In the second step, transformed images are finely registered by matching features across grids and estimating the perspective transform. Our proposed algorithm is evaluated for robustness, accuracy and speed. It is found to achieve 100% registration success on 23 image pairs which proved challenging to either of the component approaches.
756A1F27	A simple phase unwrapping approach based on windowed Fourier filtering was proposed recently [K. Qian et al. A simple phase unwrapping approach based on filtering by windowed Fourier transform. Opt Laser Technol 2005;37:458–62]. The windowed Fourier filtering algorithm is an essential ingredient that suppresses the noise effectively and makes the phase unwrapping trivial. This paper adds a note on the threshold selection in the windowed Fourier filtering algorithm. A large interval can be selected as the threshold to obtain almost optimal filtering results. Once the selected threshold is suitable, it is almost optimal. This makes the threshold selection in the windowed Fourier filtering algorithm extremely easy
7B49C500	A novel fringe projection profilometry using a single sinusoidal fringe pattern projected is proposed. Computer-generated sinusoidal fringe and uniform intensity patterns are firstly projected on a testing object by a liquid crystal display projector. The variable reflection intensity of a fringe pattern is then roughly normalized by division operation applied to the grabbed fringe and uniform intensity patterns projected. Fringe intensity is further normalized by employing an interpolation algorithm. The deformed sinusoidal pattern encoding object shape is converted to a wrapped phase map without using phase-shifting or Fourier transform. Computer simulation and experimental performance are evaluated to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. The experimental results compared with those of the four-step phase-shifting and fast Fourier transform methods are also presented.
7B2C59D3	This paper focuses on the analysis and application of an analytical model that incorporates solute diffusion within immobile regions into the three-dimensional advection/dispersion solute transport equation. The diffusion term of the model is formulated using either a first-order rate expression or an expression assuming Fickian diffusion into spherical, cylindrical, or rectangular immobile regions. In order to assist in the analysis of solute transport behavior by means of the models, a modified form of Aris's method of moments is developed, which permits the calculation of the spatial and temporal moments of solute distributions simulated using the three-dimensional diffusion models, without having to invert the Laplace- or Fourier-transformed solutions. By using this method, the moments of the diffusion models are compared with one another, with the moments of a model that assumes equilibrium advective/dispersive transport, and with the moments of a model that assumes that a first-order rate law governs mass transfer between the mobile and immobile regions. The method of moments also is used to assess the differences in the spatial and temporal moment behavior of each transport model under discussion.
76585B5F	The windowed Fourier transform is a useful technique for fringe pattern analysis. It has been shown that the proper selection of the window size is a balance between the linear phase approximation error and the influence of noise [Q. Kemao, On widow size selection in windowed Fourier ridges algorithm. Opt Lasers Eng, 2007, accepted for publication]. Since the fringe intensity and noise level usually vary spatially, the window size should also be spatially adaptive in order to reach a good balance for each pixel of the fringe pattern. This addendum first shows that the windowed Fourier transform with a spatially fixed window size (SFWS) is still practically useful and then discusses the window size competition strategies for the windowed Fourier transform with a spatially adaptive window size (SAWS). The windowed Fourier transform with a SAWS is theoretically better than that with a SFWS but it is also more challenging in use. The windowed Fourier ridges algorithm is used for analysis throughout this paper. This analysis is also applicable to the windowed Fourier filtering algorithm.
7B1590F9	In this paper we extend the classical theory of the Fourier transofrm on the space of tempered distributions. We construct a testing function space which is contained and dense in the space of rapidly decreasing functions. We introduce and study thepropertioes of the Fourier transform on this testing function space as a prelude to the introduction of the Fourier transform on its dual. We also obtain an inversinon theorem for this Fourier transform. These investigations enable us to obtain a representation theorem for the elements of the dual of this space.
7ABA40AB	Two-dimensional sinusoid fitting and Fourier transform methods of analyzing fringes to determine the wave-front topography are described. The methods are easy to apply because they do not require finding fringe centers and fringe orders. Also, they are accurate. For an active optics experiment in which we have used these techniques, experimental noise exceeds the error resulting from analysis of noise-free theoretical fringe patterns.
7ADFCAC0	This paper describes two techniques to accelerate the Fourier fringe analysis technique. The two 2-D Fourier transforms required for the technique are usually a bottleneck for good-quality images in which unwrapping is straight forward. Automation of the filtering operation is an operation that very often requires user interaction when two peaks at similar frequencies are present in the Fourier transform. The techniques presented in this paper attempt to solve these issues. The first technique proposes a reduction in the number of pixels calculated by the Fourier transform. The second, automates the filtering operation to avoid user interaction.
7A19C102	A tutorial review of both linear and quadratic representations is given. The linear representations discussed are the short-time Fourier transform and the wavelet transform. The discussion of quadratic representations concentrates on the Wigner distribution, the ambiguity function, smoothed versions of the Wigner distribution, and various classes of quadratic time-frequency representations. Examples of the application of these representations to typical problems encountered in time-varying signal processing are provided.
7C104D8B	We present an analysis of a spatial carrier-fringe pattern in three-dimensional (3-D) shape measurement by using the wavelet transform, a tool excelling for its multiresolution in the time- and space-frequency domains. To overcome the limitation of the Fourier transform, we introduce the Gabor wavelet to analyze the phase distributions of the spatial carrier-fringe pattern. The theory of wavelet transform profilometry, an accuracy check by means of a simulation, and an example of 3-D shape measurement are shown.5E61A48A
766273F7	A novel temporal phase-analysis technique that is based on wavelet analysis and a temporal carrier is presented. To measure displacement on a vibrating object by using electronic speckle pattern interferometry, one captures a series of speckle patterns, using a high-speed CCD camera. To avoid ambiguity in phase estimation, a temporal carrier is generated by a piezoelectric transducer stage in the reference beam of the interferometer. The intensity variation of each pixel on recorded images is then analyzed along the time axis by a robust mathematical tool, i.e., a complex Morlet wavelet transform. After the temporal carrier is removed, the absolute displacement of a vibrating object is obtained without the need for temporal or spatial phase unwrapping. The results obtained by a wavelet transform are compared with those from a temporal Fourier transform.
799AF997	In recent years, the fractional Fourier transform has been the focus of many research papers. In this letter, we show that the fractional Fourier transform is nothing more than a variation of the standard Fourier transform and, as such, many of its properties, such as its inversion formula and sampling theorems, can be deduced from those of the Fourier transform by a simple change of variable.
7A06C360	Phase demodulation techniques from one fringe pattern have been widely studied because it can measure dynamic objects by capturing single image. These techniques mainly include Fourier transform (FT), windowed Fourier transform (WFT), and wavelet transform (WT). FT has been widely used to demodulate phase information from single deformed fringe pattern on smooth objects. However, for objects having discontinuities and/or large slopes, FT cannot obtain correct phase at the edges because of its global processing. WFT and WT have been applied to nonstationary fringe pattern analysis. Since local fringe information used to extract phase information, WFT and WT are better than FT for phase calculation at discontinuities and/or slopes. In this paper, we discuss the pro and con of the three methods on phase calculation at discontinuities and/or slopes. Simulated and experimental data are tested at edges in order to confirm which method is appropriate to measure objects having discontinuities by using one-frame fringe pattern acquisition method.
8126D1C9	Time-limited and (a, b, c, d)-band-limited signals are of great interest not only in theory but also in real applications. In this paper, we use the sampling theorem associated with linear canonical transform to investigate an operator whose effect on a signal is to produce its first time-limited then (b, b, c, d)-band-limited version. First, the eigenvalue problem for the operator is shown to be equivalent to a discrete eigenvalue problem for an infinite matrix. Then the eigenfunctions of the operator, which are referred to as generalized prolate spheroidal wave functions (GPSWFs), are shown to be first, orthogonal over finite as well as infinite intervals, and second, complete over L2(-L, L) and the class of (a, b, c, d)-band-limited signals. A simple method based on sampling theorem for computing GPSWFs is presented and the definite parity of GPSWFs is also given. Finally, based on the dual orthogonality and completeness of GPSWFs, several applications of GPSWFs to the representation of time-limited and (a, b, c, d)-band-limited signals are presented.
78268DE2	Preliminary results from a Bayesian approach to find periodicities in the IntCal98 calibration curve are given. It has been shown in the literature that the discrete Fourier transform (Schuster periodogram) corresponds to the use of an approximate Bayesian model of one harmonic frequency and Gaussian noise. Advantages of the Bayesian approach include the possibility to use models for variable, attenuated and multiple frequencies, the capability to analyze unevenly spaced data and the possibility to assess the significance and uncertainties of spectral estimates. In this work, a new Bayesian model using random walk noise to take care of the trend in the data is developed. Both Bayesian models are described and the first results of the new model are reported and compared with results from straightforward discrete-Fourier-transform and maximum-entropy-method spectral analyses
7923F773	In this paper we consider logspline density estimation for random variables which are contaminated with random noise. In the logspline density estimation for data without noise, the logarithm of an unknown density function is estimated by a polynomial spline, the unknown parameters of which are given by maximum likelihood. When noise is present, B-splines and the Fourier inversion formula are used to construct the logspline density estimator of the unknown density function. Rates of convergence are established when the log-density function is assumed to be in a Besov space. It is shown that convergence rates depend on the smoothness of the density function and the decay rate of the characteristic function of the noise. Simulated data are used to show the finite-sample performance of inference based on the logspline density estimation.
7C2E7FFD	We show that if f is in an anisotropic Hardy space HpA, 0 < p ≤ 1, with respect to a dilation matrix A, then its Fourier transform f̂ satisfies the pointwise estimate Here, ρ* is a quasi-norm associated with the transposed matrix A*. This leads to necessary conditions for functions m to be multipliers on HpA, as well as further pointwise characterizations on f̂ and a generalization of the Hardy-Littlewood inequality on the integrability of f̂. This last result is strengthened through the use of rearrangement functions. 
79B907AC	A refinement of the Fourier transform fringe-pattern analysis technique which uses a 2-D Fourier transform is described. The 2-D transform permits better separation of the desired information components from unwanted components than a 1-D transform. The accuracy of the technique when applied to real data recorded by a system with a nonlinear response function is investigated. This leads to simple techniques for optimizing an interferogram for analysis by these Fourier transform methods and to an estimate of the error in the retrieved fringe shifts. This estimate is tested on simulated data and found to be reliable.
7BE1A8CD	The present paper deals with the synthesis and characterization of ZnO nanoparticles obtained by coprecipitation method at three different pH conditions. Samples characterizations aimed at understanding their spectroscopic properties are carried out using a variety of experimental techniques. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopic studies show significant increase in the particle size of the synthesized ZnO nanoparticles ranging from 3–40 nm with increasing pH values. Absorption spectra show particle size dependent blueshift in the energy band, which may be ascribed to quantum confinement effect. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveals enhancement in the surface defects of the synthesized ZnO nanoparticles with increasing pH values. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies at room temperature (300 K) and several liquid helium temperatures (including the lowest temperature 13 K for all samples) indicate the presence of singly ionized oxygen vacancy defects (VO+) and O2− superoxide ions in the ZnO nanoparticles. These results are well supported by FTIR and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The emissions from these nanoparticles are also found to be size dependent, whereas the ratio of UV emission to oxygen vacancy related green emission is found to increase with increasing pH values. Furthermore, a plausible mechanism of the observed defect mediated green emission is proposed.
7A7D4306	A windowed Fourier ridges (WFR) algorithm and a windowed Fourier filtering (WFF) algorithm have been proposed for fringe pattern analysis and have been demonstrated to be versatile and effective. Theoretical analyses of their performances are of interest. Local frequency and phase extraction errors by the WFR and WFF algorithms are analyzed in this paper. Effectiveness of the WFR and WFF algorithms will thus be theoretically proven. Consider four phase-shifted fringe patterns with local quadric phase [𝑐20=𝑐02=0.005  rad/(pixel)2], and assume that the noise in these fringe patterns have mean values of zero and standard deviations the same as the fringe amplitude. If the phase is directly obtained using the four-step phase-shifting algorithm, the phase error has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 0.7 rad. However, when using the WFR algorithm with a window size of 𝜎𝑥=𝜎𝑦=10 pixels, the local frequency extraction error has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of less than 0.01  rad/pixel and the phase extraction error in the WFR algorithm has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of about 0.02 rad. When using the WFF algorithm with the same window size, the phase extraction error has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of less than 0.04 rad and the local frequency extraction error also has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of less than 0.01  rad/pixel. Thus, an unbiased estimation with very low standard deviation is achievable for local frequencies and phase distributions through windowed Fourier transforms. Algorithms applied to different fringe patterns, different noise models, and different dimensions are discussed. The theoretical analyses are verified by numerical simulations.
75B60CD2	Windowed Fourier transform (WFT) has been proved to be one of the most effective algorithms for extracting phase from various optical fringe patterns. The accuracy of phase retrieval using WFT depends on the preset window size, but how to determine an appropriate window size is still a problem. In this paper, a mathematical relationship between the optimal window size and the phase derivative is deduced and several advices on window size selection in practical applications are proposed. The correctness of the proposed window size selection criterions is demonstrated using both numeral simulations and real experiments. Comparison of phase values retrieved by conventional approaches and WFT shows that the WFT with an optimal window size can give more precise results.
7C3CA7A1	 fast-Fourier-transform method of topography and interferometry is proposed. By computer processing of a noncontour type of fringe pattern, automatic discrimination is achieved between elevation and depression of the object or wave-front form, which has not been possible by the fringe-contour-generation techniques. The method has advantages over moiré topography and conventional fringe-contour interferometry in both accuracy and sensitivity. Unlike fringe-scanning techniques, the method is easy to apply because it uses no moving components.
7812FC67	Fourier transform techniques have been used to map the complex fringe visibility in several types of interferogram. A Gerchberg-type iterative technique is used to eliminate edge effects. Results are presented for two specific cases: seeing measurements and interferometric tests.
7CC2F05A	Carrier removal is a key step in the Fourier transform method (FTM) of fringe pattern analysis because it can give rise to significant errors in the recovered phase. The existing methods of fringe carrier removal in the FTM are reviewed and a comparison of three different methods, translation of the sidelobe to the frequency origin, leastsquares fit and subtraction of the phase of the undeformed carrier fringes, are presented. Computer-generated fringe patterns are used to determine the differences between the original and the retrieved phase distributions. Several figures of merit are proposed to assess the performance of the mentioned methods. Experimental fringe patterns, obtained by double-pulsed-subtraction TV holography, are analyzed by the methods considered here, and the retrieved phase distributions are also compared.
7CECEF00	A method to measure the derivative of displacement using time variation changes in the object together with Fourier transform analysis in speckle shear interferometry is presented. The concept of the method is that the object is deformed continuously and a large number of sheared images of the object motion are acquired using a high speed CCD camera. The derivative of the object deformation is then retrieved from this large set of data using Fourier transformation. The method is capable of obtaining information for object displacements over 500 µm, which is a very difficult task when using conventional electronic speckle pattern shearing interferometry. Theory as well as some of the experimental results with the new method are delineated. 
63A16A48	We investigate a vector-valued version of the classical continuous wavelet transform. Special attention is given to the case when the analyzing vector consists of the first elements of the basis of admissible functions, namely the functions whose Fourier transform is a Laguerre function. In this case, the resulting spaces are, up to a multiplier isomorphism, poly-Bergman spaces. To demonstrate this fact, we introduce a new map and call it the polyanalytic Bergman transform. Our method of proof uses Vasilevski’s restriction principle for Bergman-type spaces. The construction is based on the idea of multiplexing of signals.
767F8E44	Microwave spectra of ground state 20Ne:1H79Br, 20Ne:1H81Br, 22Ne:1H79Br, 22Ne:1H81Br, and their corresponding deuterated isotopomers are obtained using pulsed-nozzle Fourier Transform microwave spectroscopy. The 20Ne:1H79Br ground state is characteristic of a nearly free rotor. The available 20Ne:1H79Br, 20Ne:2H79Br, 22Ne:1H79Br and 22Ne:2H79Br data are analyzed and used to determine an initial ground vibrational state morphed potential for the dimer. This resulting intermolecular potential indicates a global minimum Ne:BrH linear isomeric structure with Rcm = 3.42 A. These analyses also provide structural perspectives on the prototypical homologous series Rg:HX (Rg = Ne, Ar, Kr; X = F, Cl, Br, I).
76304D99	We define convolution of two distributions in the spaces , in two ways, which turn out to be equivalent, and show that the space is closed under convolution. We also define the Fourier transform of elements of , and prove the Parseval equality.
7856AE9C	Fringe pattern analysis in coded structured light constitutes an active field of research. Techniques based on first projecting a sinusoidal pattern and then recovering the phase deviation permit the computation of the phase map and its corresponding depth map, leading to a dense acquisition of the measuring object. Among these techniques, the ones based on time-frequency analysis permit to extract the depth map from a single image, thus having potential applications measuring moving objects. The main techniques are Fourier Transform (FT), Windowed Fourier Transform (WFT) and Wavelet Transform (WT). This paper first analyzes the pros and cons of these three techniques, then a new algorithm for the automatic selection of the window size in WFT is proposed. This algorithm is compared to the traditional WT using adapted mother wavelet signals both with simulated and real objects, showing the performance results for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the new method.
7525E64B	An important issue, mosaic grating compressor, is studied to recompress pulses for multiPetawatt, high energy laser systems. Alignment of the mosaic elements is crucial to control the focal spot and thus the intensity on target. No theoretical approach analyses the influence of compressor misalignment on spatial and temporal profiles in the focal plane. We describe a simple 3D numerical model giving access to the focal plane view after a compressor. This model is computationally inexpensive since it needs only 1D Fourier transforms to access to the temporal profile. We present simulations of monolithic and mosaic grating compressors
7CB31B6E	This note describes a new Banach space B0 of square integrable functions on Rd having many interesting invariance properties. In fact, the Fourier transform, time–frequency shifts, and L2–normalized dilations act isometrically on it. For its definition, we make use of a general construction principle for minimal invariant spaces. We demonstrate a variety of properties following immediately from this principle. Furthermore, we give a number of different characterizations, including various atomic decompositions, as well as natural necessary and sufficient conditions for an L2–function to belong to this new space. It turns out that this new space is somewhat exotic, since it is neither rearrangement invariant nor solid 
8145DF2D	This correspondence derives the uncertainty principle bounds for the linear canonical transform (LCT) of a complex signal. The derived bounds are sharper than that of the published papers and they are related with the phase and the amplitude of the complex signal. An example is given to verify the result.
7DC50563	The functional Fourier transform (FRFT), which is a generalization of the classical Fourier transform, was introduced a number of years ago in the mathematics literature but appears to have remained largely unknown to the signal processing community, to which it may, however, be potentially useful. The FRFT depends on a parameter /spl alpha/ and can be interpreted as a rotation by an angle /spl alpha/ in the time-frequency plane. An FRFT with /spl alpha/=/spl pi//2 corresponds to the classical Fourier transform, and an FRFT with /spl alpha/=0 corresponds to the identity operator. On the other hand, the angles of successively performed FRFTs simply add up, as do the angles of successive rotations. The FRFT of a signal can also be interpreted as a decomposition of the signal in terms of chirps. The authors briefly introduce the FRFT and a number of its properties and then present some new results: the interpretation as a rotation in the time-frequency plane, and the FRFT's relationships with time-frequency representations such as the Wigner distribution, the ambiguity function, the short-time Fourier transform and the spectrogram. These relationships have a very simple and natural form and support the FRFT's interpretation as a rotation operator. Examples of FRFTs of some simple signals are given. An example of the application of the FRFT is also given.
5E635609	For the pre-acquired serial images from camera lengthways motion, a view synthesis algorithm based on epipolar geometry constraint is proposed in this paper. It uses the whole matching and maintaining order characters of the epipolar line, Fourier transform and dynamic programming matching theories, thus truly synthesizing the destination image of current viewpoint. Through the combination of Fourier transform, epipolar geometry constraint and dynamic programming matching, the circumference distortion problem resulting from conventional view synthesis approaches is effectively avoided. The detailed implementation steps of this algorithm are given, and some running instances are presented to illustrate the results.
7593BE46	The prospects for converting angle-resolved photoemission data from reciprocal space to real space are evaluated. Examples are given for one- and two-dimensional systems, where wave functions have been obtained for quantum well states confined between steps and for planar molecules adsorbed at a surface. The extension to three-dimensional systems via variable photon energies is discussed. The uncertainty relation between position and momentum makes such a capability complementary to imaging in real space by scanning tunneling microscopy. Angle-resolved photoemission provides access to the internal structure of an electronic orbital and penetrates below the surface.
76781512	Phase demodulation techniques from one fringe pattern have been widely studied because it can measure dynamic objects by capturing single image. These techniques mainly include Fourier transform (FT), windowed Fourier transform (WFT), and wavelet transform (WT). FT has been widely used to demodulate phase information from single deformed fringe pattern on smooth objects. However, for objects having discontinuities and/or large slopes, FT cannot obtain correct phase at the edges because of its global processing. WFT and WT have been applied to nonstationary fringe pattern analysis. Since local fringe information used to extract phase information, WFT and WT are better than FT for phase calculation at discontinuities and/or slopes. In this paper, we discuss the pro and con of the three methods on phase calculation at discontinuities and/or slopes. Simulated and experimental data are tested at edges in order to confirm which method is appropriate to measure objects having discontinuities by using one-frame fringe pattern acquisition method.
7DF2C44F	This correspondence investigates the uncertainty principles under the linear canonical transform (LCT). First, a lower bound on the uncertainty product of signal representations in two LCT domains for complex signals is derived, which can be achieved by a complex chirp signal with Gaussian envelope. Then, the tighter lower bound for real signals in two LCT domains proposed by Sharma and Joshi is also proven to hold for arbitrary LCT parameters based on the properties of moments for the LCT. The uncertainty principle for the fractional Fourier transform is a special case of the achieved results
79206ED2	Linear canonical transform (LCT) is an integral transform with four parameters a, b, c, d and has been shown to be a powerful tool for optics, radar system analysis, filter design, phase retrieval, pattern recognition, and many other applications. Many well-known transforms such as the Fourier transform, the fractional Fourier transform, and the Fresnel transform can be seen as special cases of the linear canonical transform. In this paper, new sampling formulae for reconstructing signals that are band-limited or time-limited in the linear canonical transform sense have been proposed. Firstly, the sampling theorem representation of band-limited signals associated with linear canonical transform from the samples taken at Nyquist rate is derived in a simple way. Then, based on the relationship between the Fourier transform and the linear canonical transform, the other two new sampling formulae using samples taken at half the Nyquist rate from the signal and its first derivative or its generalized Hilbert transform are obtained. The well-known sampling theorems in Fourier domain or fractional Fourier domain are shown to be special cases of the achieved results. The experimental results are also proposed to verify the accuracy of the obtained results. Finally, discussions about these new results and future works related to the linear canonical transform are proposed.
7AF189EC	To mitigate the negative traffic impact caused by work zones, land transport authorities usually impose constraints on queue length and travel delay. In reality, a single or multiple subwork zone strategy can be adopted to mitigate queue length and travel delay. However, contractors conducting work projects are only concerned with the minimization of the total maintenance cost. From the contractor’s standpoint, this study proposes a total maintenance cost minimization model to determine the optimal subwork zone length and project start time, subject to queue length and travel delay constraints. Using average hourly traffic (AHT) data, this study shows that total user delay is non-differentiable with respect to the subwork zone length and project start time. This interesting finding demonstrates that previous analytic expressions of the optimal subwork zone length cannot hold for AHT data. To solve the proposed model, an enumeration method is designed. Finally, a numerical example created from the roadside tree trimming in Singapore is used to assess the model and solution method proposed in this study.
776EE54F	A spaceis constructed and some characterizations of space are given. It is shown that the classical Fourier transform is extended to the distribution space , which can be embedded into the Schwartz distribution space continuously. It is also shown that is the biggest embedded subspace of which the extended Fourier transform, , is a homeomorphism of onto itself.
7B5CEA0A	A simple phase unwrapping approach based on windowed Fourier filtering (WFF) was proposed recently. In this paper, the effects of the WFF on edges are further investigated, which show that the phase near an edge remains unchanged and no special consideration is needed for the edges. This useful property will be theoretically proven and numerically verified.
75DD3DF9	Linear canonical transforms play an important role in many fields of optics and signal processing. Well-known transforms such as the Fourier transform, the fractional Fourier transform, and the Fresnel transform can be seen as special cases of the linear canonical transform. In this paper we develop a sampling theorem for linear canonical transformed signals. The well-known Shannon sampling theorem and previously developed sampling criteria for Fresnel and fractional Fourier transformed signals are shown to be a special cases of the theorem developed here.
76A746CD	The spatial resolution of the phase image derived from the interferogram by Fourier fringe analysis is limited by the necessity to isolate a first order in the Fourier plane. By use of the two complementary outputs of the interferometer, it is possible to eliminate the zero order and thus to improve the spatial resolution by a factor of approximately 2. The theory of this improvement is presented and confirmed experimentally.
7ADECF60	Every estimation concerning model parameters has to deal with uncertainty, but its quantification is a complex task to solve, especially for the identification of the different uncertainty sources that affect the system. In this paper we provide an extensive uncertainty analysis on the calibration model of a Fourier-transform profilometry, studying the effect of the uncertainty parameters estimation on the final measuring result. The methods used for the classification are discrete derivatives and the global sensitivity analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations. The experimental results show that the uncertainty propagation of the system parameters to the output strongly depends on different system setups that may be chosen. This dependency is analysed and interpreted.
7623715C	This paper describes a new method to be used for matching three-dimensional objects with curved surfaces to two-dimensional perspective views. The method requires for each three-dimensional object a stored model consisting of a closed space curve representing some characteristic connected curved edges of the object. The input is a two-dimensional perspective projection of one of the stored models represented by an ordered sequence of points. The input is converted to a spline representation which is sampled at equal intervals to derive a curvature function. The Fourier transform of the curvature function is used to represent the shape. The actual matching is reduced to a minimization problem which is handled by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
7A91AA01	We present gradient expressions for a closed-loop parametric identification scheme. The method is based on the minimization of a standard identification criterion and a parametrization that is tailored to the closed-loop configuration. It is shown that for both linear and nonlinear plants and controllers, the gradient signals can be computed exactly.
79CF69D5	We investigate a vector-valued version of the classical continuous wavelet transform. Special attention is given to the case when the analyzing vector consists of the first elements of the basis of admissible functions, namely the functions whose Fourier transform is a Laguerre function. In this case, the resulting spaces are, up to a multiplier isomorphism, poly-Bergman spaces. To demonstrate this fact, we introduce a new map and call it the polyanalytic Bergman transform. Our method of proof uses Vasilevski’s restriction principle for Bergman-type spaces. The construction is based on the idea of multiplexing of signals.
75DA2D38	A novel Fourier transform 3D shape measurement method based on color fringe projection is proposed in order to solve the spectrum overlapping and phase unwrapping problems existed in Fourier transform profilometry (FTP). The R and G components of the color fringe are set to two sinusoidal patterns with different frequencies and the B component is set to the average value of R or G component. Then this pattern is projected to the object and the deformed fringe image is captured. Three gray patterns are separated from the color fringe, the background and high frequency noise can be eliminated using our method and the accurate unwrapped phase can be got. Only one shot color pattern is projected to get the 3D information of the object. Experiment results show that the 3D information of an object can be obtained rapidly and accurately.
759B6964	This paper develops a representation for discrete-time signals and systems based on short-time Fourier analysis. The short-time Fourier transform and the time-varying frequency response are reviewed as representations for signals and linear time-varying systems. The problems of representing a signal by its short-time Fourier transform and synthesizing a signal from its transform are considered. A new synthesis equation is introduced that is sufficiently general to describe apparently different synthesis methods reported in the literature. It is shown that a class of linear-filtering problems can be represented as the product of the time-varying frequency response of the filter multiplied by the short-time Fourier transform of the input signal. The representation of a signal by samples of its short-time Fourier transform is applied to the linear filtering problem. This representation is of practical significance because there exists a computationally efficient algorithm for implementing such systems. Finally, the methods of fast convolution age considered as special cases of this representation.
7D72E466	The linear canonical transform (LCT) is a generalization of the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) having applications in several areas of signal processing and optics. In this paper, we extend the uncertainty principle for real signals in the fractional Fourier domains to the linear canonical transform domains, giving us the tighter lower bound on the product of the spreads of the signal in two specific LCT domains than the existing lower bounds in the LCT domains. It is seen that this lower bound can be achieved by a Gaussian signal. The effect of time-shifting and scaling the signal on the uncertainty principle is also discussed. It is shown here that a signal bandlimited in one LCT domain can be bandlimited in some other LCT domains also. The exceptions to the uncertainty principle in the LCT domains arising out of this are also discussed.
7C82C962	Fringe patterns from optical metrology systems need to be demodulated to get the desired parameters. Two-dimensional windowed Fourier transform is chosen for the determination of phase and phase derivatives. Two algorithms, one based on filtering and the other based on similarity measure, are developed. Some applications based on these two algorithms are explored, including strain determination, phase unwrapping, phase-shifter calibration, fault detection, edge detection and fringe segmentation. Various examples are given to demonstrate the ideas. Finally implementations of these algorithms are addressed. Most of the work has appeared in various papers and its originality is not claimed. Instead, this paper gives an overview and more insights of our work on windowed Fourier transform.
7A71595A	A hybrid system has been constructed to perform the complex Fourier transform of real 2-D data. The system is based on the Radon transform; i.e., operations are performed on 1-D projections of the data. The projections are derived optically from transmissive or reflective objects, and the complex Fourier transform is performed with SAW filters via the chirp transform algorithm. The real and imaginary parts of the 2-D transform are produced in two bipolar output channels.
77D48DA0	The measurement of dynamic displacements by use of speckle pattern interferometry and temporal phase unwrapping allows for the evaluation of large-object displacement fields without the propagation of spatial unwrapping errors. If a temporal carrier is introduced in one of the beams of the interferometer, phase data for whole-object displacement can be retrieved by use of a temporal phase-shifting method or a temporal Fourier transformation approach. We present a comparison between both methods of temporal phase measurement in terms of precision and execution speed. We performed the analysis by using computer-simulated speckle interferograms, an approach that allowed us to know precisely the original phase distribution and also to determine the spatial rms phase error as a function of the phase change introduced between two consecutive speckle interferograms. The performance of both methods to process experimental data is also illustrated by use of the results from a high-speed speckle interferometry study of a carbon fiber panel.
79DD880A	The ambiguity function (AF) as an important tool for time-frequency analysis, has widely been used in radar signal processing, sonar technology and so on. It does well in analysing chirp signals. However, it fails in estimating the cubic phase (CP) signal, which is required in many applications. As the generalisation of the Fourier transform (FT), the linear canonical transform (LCT) has received much attention, and has found many applications in filter design, pattern recognition, optics and so on. In this study, the authors define a new kind of AF - the AF based on the LCT (LCTAF), which is proposed to estimate the CP signal. Some important properties of LCTAF are discussed, such as symmetry and conjugation property, shifting property and Moyal formula. The relationships between the LCTAF and other time-frequency analysis distributions are derived, including the classical AF, the Wigner distribution function (WDF) based on LCT, the short-FT and the wavelet transform. The linear canonical AF (LCAF) is another kind of AF. The authors also discuss its relation with AF and WDF and give some new properties of the LCAF. At last, the LCTAF is applied for estimating the CP signal. The simulation indicates that the LCTAF is useful and effective.
8131FBD3	A new computer-based technique for automatic 3-D shape measurement is proposed and verified by experiments. In contrast to the moire contouring technique, a grating pattern projected onto the object surface is Fourier-transformed and processed in its spatial frequency domain as well as in its space-signal domain. This technique has a much higher sensitivity than the conventional moire technique and is capable of fully automatic distinction between a depression and an elevation on the object surface. There is no requirement for assigning fringe orders and interpolating data in the regions between contour fringes. The technique is free from errors caused by spurious moire fringes generated by the higher harmonic components of the grating pattern.
