7F655C79	Abstract—For the task of image segmentation in image processing, we propose an arithmetic of image processing based on fuzzy cellular automata. It combines the theory of cellular automata and fuzzy rule to establish a model of fuzzy cellular automata. Thus, the pixels whose grey level is between object and background can be handled well, and good result of image segmentation can be got.
