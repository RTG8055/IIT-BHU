12915FE4	Abstract—In this paper, the problem of finding good wordlength combinations for fixed-point digital signal processing flowgraphs is addressed. By formulating and solving an approximate optimization problem, an estimated Pareto-optimal curve for attainable cost/quality combinations is rapidly calculated. This curve and the associated wordlength combinations are useful in several situations and can serve as starting points for real design searches. Examples that illustrate these concepts are given.
